[00:43.88] Sun's up
[00:45.94] Another day goes by
[00:47.99] Look at the time fly
[00:51.23] Keep up
[00:53.04] The different air gives us that
[00:55.49] Feeling of being alive
[01:06.49] 
[00:59.36] Wander through the warmer colors
[01:01.14] Across the cooler asphalt
[01:02.83] All the leaves go dancing on about
[01:04.88] Drifting in and out of sight
[01:06.36] When summer's over I'll be around
[01:08.45] If you need I'll keep you warmed up
[01:09.87] When the town dims down
[01:11.32] I'll be around
[01:11.91] If you need I'll light the light
[01:27.91] 
[01:57.51] Sun's up
[01:59.25] Another day goes by
[02:01.37] Look at the time fly
[02:04.93] Keep up
[02:06.33] The different air gives us
[02:08.73] That feeling of being alive
[02:22.23] 
[02:12.52] We are just another visitor
[02:14.68] In a transient world
[02:15.83] So we might be limited
[02:17.93] But we know the heart is infinite
[02:19.74] Hold true to my beliefs
[02:21.28] And pushing ahead with utter confidence
[02:23.56] On towards the future
[02:24.80] You and I and all of us here decide
